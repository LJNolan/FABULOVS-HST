Code utilized in Nolan et al. 2025, FABULOVS-HST.  AFFOGATO and supernolan both may have general use, and are written with thorough documentation.  AFFOGATO will be the subject of a follow-up letter to the Journal of Open Source Software, and updated versions may be present in a separate, dedicated repository.  All other code should be workable in the supplied environment.yml, assuming one has downloaded the appropriate files as linked in our paper.

Our paper references both example GALFIT files and visual inspections - these can be found as 'input/4701' and 'visual_inspections.txt' respectively.
